The Voice of my Beloved;\n   Though asleep, my heart wakes.\n   He stands knocking\n     on the door cry’ng\n   “Open, for love’s sake!\n   Precious are My thoughts\n     toward you,\n   That distil like the dew,\n   Let Me come in\n     and sup with you!”\n\n3. The Voice of my Beloved;\n   He is singing sweetly,\n   “It’s your countenance\n     My fair one,\n   That has ravished Me!\n   Let us enter secret places,\n   And there pray earnestly –\n   Till Morning break\n     and shadows flee”.\n\n4. The Voice of my Beloved;\n   As a trumpet will sound,\n   From eternity like thunder\n   Echoed in the clouds.\n   We’ll be raptured in a twinkling,\n   When He gathers us ‘round.\n   Oh, praise the Lord,\n     we’re glory bound!\n\nBridge - English:\n       |6|*m*\n   My Beloved, Jesus, He is mine;\n         |4|                   |1| *-*|1|*7*\n   My Beloved, Jesus, He is mine;\n         |11|*m*     |4|\n   And I will praise,\n            |9|         |6|*m*\n   I will praise the Lord\n        |4|       |1|           |6|*m*\n   My Beloved, Jesus, He is mine!\n\nBridge - Hebrew:\n     |6|*m*\n   Yeshua, ahuvi sheli\n      |4|           |1| *-*|1|*7*\n   Yeshua, ahuvi sheli\n      |11|*m*   |4|           |9|  |6|*m*\n   V’Ahale–el,   halel Adonai\n     |4|      |1|    |6|*m*\n   Yeshua, ahuvi sheli!\n\nEnding: Hallelujah... etc.\n\n© 2011 New Covenant Pentecostal Church",

Wounded by scourging,\n   He walked the way to Calvary\n   Slowly ascending,\n   The heavy cross He bore for me;\n   Suffering in silence and\n   enduring the pain,\n   He thought of me, He thought of me!\n\n4. Reckoned with sinners,\n   The Saviour nailed and crucified\n   Demons of darkness\n   By death of Christ are mortified!\n   Salvation purchased,\n   And the vict’ry is won,\n   This is our God! This is our God!\n\n5. Crucified Saviour,\n   He beckons you to come to Him\n   Make your decision and boldly\n   Show your love to Him\n   Take up your cross now,\n   Lay your life down for Him\n   Until the end, until the end!\n\n© The Pentecostal Mission",
